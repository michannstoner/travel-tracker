# Away - Travel Tracker
A solo project by [Michann Stoner](https://github.com/michannstoner). Original project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

### Description
Away is the start of a travel tracker application. As a user, you will be prompted to log in, and then be taken to your dashboard. The dashboard will allow you to book a new trip by entering a date, duration of trip, and number of travelers. You will also be able to view pending, or all trips, and see your total spent on travel this year.

- GitHub projects for the [project board](https://github.com/michannstoner/travel-tracker/projects/1)

### Wins & Challenges 

#### Wins 
- Ultimately, I feel like I learned a lot from this project. This was a much more 'full' application than what I had built alone previously. From building out class structures, to tests, and then separate API files, DOM files, and several SCSS files. I'm proud of myself for fetching data and being able to POST new data to an API. 

#### Challenges 
- I feel like the most challenging thing was getting all of the files to play nice with each other. This was my second time using Webpack and having a separate file for API calls, DOM updates, etc. Getting the timing right with Asynchronous JavaScript was challenging at first. 


### Future Plans for Application
- Build out a more dynamic login page
- Add a 'logout' feature 
- Add more animations or styling in general
